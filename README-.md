## Overview

It takes an input of IP address or domain and returns the goelocation of the IP/Domain

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
map.setView([lat, lng], 17);

L.marker([lat, lng]).addTo(map);
```

### Continued development

I would like to work more with APIs
